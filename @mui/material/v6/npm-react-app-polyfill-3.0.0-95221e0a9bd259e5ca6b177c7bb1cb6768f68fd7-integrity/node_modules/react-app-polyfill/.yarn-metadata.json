    "readme": "# react-app-polyfill\n\nThis package includes polyfills for various browsers.\nIt includes minimum requirements and commonly used language features used by [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) projects.\n\n### Usage\n\nFirst, install the package using Yarn or npm:\n\n```sh\nnpm install react-app-polyfill\n```\n\nor\n\n```sh\nyarn add react-app-polyfill\n```\n\n## Supporting Internet Explorer\n\nYou can import the entry point for the minimal version you intend to support to ensure that the minimum language features are present that are required to use Create React App. For example, if you import the IE9 entry point, this will include IE10 and IE11 support.\n\nThese modules ensure the following language features are present:\n\n1. `Promise` (for `async` / `await` support)\n1. `window.fetch` (a Promise-based way to make web requests in the browser)\n1. `Object.assign` (a helper required for Object Spread, i.e. `{ ...a, ...b }`)\n1. `Symbol` (a built-in object used by `for...of` syntax and friends)\n1. `Array.from` (a built-in static method used by array spread, i.e. `[...arr]`)\n\n_If you need more features, see the [Polyfilling other language features](#polyfilling-other-language-features) section below._\n\n#### Internet Explorer 9\n\n```js\n// This must be the first line in src/index.js\nimport 'react-app-polyfill/ie9';\n\n// ...\n```\n\n#### Internet Explorer 11\n\n```js\n// This must be the first line in src/index.js\nimport 'react-app-polyfill/ie11';\n\n// ...\n```\n\n## Polyfilling other language features\n\nYou can also polyfill stable language features not available in your target browsers. If you're using this in Create React App, it will automatically use the `browserslist` you've defined to only include polyfills needed by your target browsers when importing the `stable` polyfill. **Make sure to follow the Internet Explorer steps above if you need to support Internet Explorer in your application**.\n\n```js\n// This must be the first line in src/index.js\nimport 'react-app-polyfill/stable';\n\n// ...\n```\n\nIf you are supporting Internet Explorer 9 or Internet Explorer 11 you should include both the `ie9` or `ie11` and `stable` modules:\n\nFor IE9:\n\n```js\n// These must be the first lines in src/index.js\nimport 'react-app-polyfill/ie9';\nimport 'react-app-polyfill/stable';\n\n// ...\n```\n\nFor IE11:\n\n```js\n// These must be the first lines in src/index.js\nimport 'react-app-polyfill/ie11';\nimport 'react-app-polyfill/stable';\n\n// ...\n```\n",
