A `history` object abstracts away the differences in various environments and provides a minimal API that lets you manage the history stack, navigate, and persist state between sessions.\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation for version 5 can be found in the [docs](docs) directory. This is the current stable release. Version 5 is used in React Router version 6.\n\nDocumentation for version 4 can be found [on the v4 branch](https://github.com/remix-run/history/tree/v4/docs). Version 4 is used in React Router versions 4 and 5.\n\n## Changes\n\nTo see the changes that were made in a given release, please lookup the tag on [the releases page](https://github.com/remix-run/history/releases).\n\nFor changes released in version 4.6.3 and earlier, please see [the `CHANGES.md` file](https://github.com/remix-run/history/blob/845d690c5576c7f55ecbe14babe0092e8e5bc2bb/CHANGES.md).\n\n## Development\n\nDevelopment of the current stable release, version 5, happens on [the `main` branch](https://github.com/remix-run/history/tree/main). Please keep in mind that this branch may include some work that has not yet been published as part of an official release. However, since `main` is always stable, you should feel free to build your own working release straight from `main` at any time.\n\nIf you're interested in helping out, please read [our contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## About\n\n`history` is developed and maintained by [Remix](https://remix.run). If you're interested in learning more about what React can do for your company, please [get in touch](mailto:hello@remix.run)!\n\n## Thanks\n\nA big thank-you to [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/) for providing the infrastructure that allows us to run our build in real browsers.\n\nAlso, thanks to [Dan Shaw](https://www.npmjs.com/~dshaw) for letting us use the `history` npm package name. Thanks, Dan!\n",
